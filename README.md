# Market Template

```c
"Will {Service Provider}'s {Metric/Criteria} {Threshold} within the next {Duration}?"
```

# How to Use the Template
**Identify the Service Provider:** Choose the infrastructure provider you want to create a market for (e.g., Infura, Alchemy).
**Select the Metric/Criteria:** Determine which performance aspect you want to evaluate (e.g., API response time, uptime).
**Set the Threshold:** Define the specific condition or value that will determine the Yes/No outcome (e.g., below 500 milliseconds).
**Define the Duration:** Specify the time frame for the evaluation (e.g., next 30 days)

# Examples

Will Infura's average API response time remain below 500 milliseconds over the next 30 days?
Will Infura experience more than three service outages lasting longer than one hour in the next quarter?
Will Infura achieve and maintain 99.99% uptime over the next twelve months?
Will Infura reduce its API latency by at least 10% in the upcoming quarter?
Will Alchemy's average API latency remain below 300 milliseconds over the next 30 days?
Will Alchemy maintain an API uptime exceeding 99.95% in the next quarter?
Will Alchemy's API downtime rate exceed 0.1% in the upcoming month?
Will both Infura and Alchemy maintain their respective API response time thresholds (<500ms for Infura and <300ms for Alchemy) consistently over the next 30 days?
